# Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, journey date, source, destination, and duration using machine learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed flight booking data
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applied feature engineering on date and categorical variables
- Trained machine learning models for price prediction
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics

## 📊 Key Results
- Built a regression model to predict flight prices
- Improved prediction accuracy through preprocessing and feature selection
